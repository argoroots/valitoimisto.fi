# Accounting

We have provided reliable and professional accounting services in Finland for over 10 years.

Paperless accounting is the way of today. Years of balance sheet experience ensure a personalised approach based on the specificities of your business, together with a consultancy service. We’ve used various accounting software over the years and today, we’re using the Fennoa accounting software. These software tools offer the option of completely paperless accounting. Fennoa also allows us to ensure mutual digital data exchange as well as rapid and operational access to data anytime, anywhere, wherever an Internet connection is available. Only pay for what you need. Services sold on the basis of an hourly fee are calculated to the nearest 15 minutes and the scope of all consultations and special works will be agreed with the client in advance.

Our accounting service is aimed at companies for whom employing a full-time accountant it is not practical. Cooperation can range from professional advice to a comprehensive financial solution.
