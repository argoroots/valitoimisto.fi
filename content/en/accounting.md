# Accounting

We have been providing reliable and professional accounting services in Finland for over 10 years.

In today's digital age, paperless accounting is the way forward. With years of experience in balance sheets, we offer a personalized approach tailored to the specific needs of your business, along with consultancy services. We have worked with various accounting software in the past, and currently, we use the Fennoa accounting software. This software enables completely paperless accounting and allows for seamless digital data exchange, ensuring quick and easy access to your financial data from anywhere with an internet connection. Our services are flexible, and you only pay for what you need, with hourly fees calculated to the nearest 15 minutes. We always discuss the scope of consultations and special projects with our clients in advance.
