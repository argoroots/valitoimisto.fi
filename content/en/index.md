# Invoice for your work - without owning a company

Through our company, you can submit invoices for your work done in Finland without owning a company yourself. If you want to save both time and money on establishing a company, the multiple insurances required, monthly accounting services and liquidation, our service is for you.

If your work isn’t time-consuming and/or is seasonal, if you’re just trying out living and working in Finland, or if you’re doing a variety of jobs during a chaotic time, then we’re for you.

::pricing
## The price of the service

We offer the Light Entrepreneur service for those who need to submit invoices for short-term or smaller jobs without having to own a company and we’ll pay you a remuneration, where all the taxes required under an ordinary employment contract, such as TYEL insurance, the right employee pension insurance, etc., have been paid on your salary. As a Light Entrepreneur, the payment for most insurances is your obligation, so we advise you to read our terms and conditions, and make sure you are familiar with effective law.

The price of our intermediation service is 4% of each invoice submitted and received for your work (the amount excluding VAT), and our service includes issuing one sales invoice and receiving one purchase invoice (related to the given work and service) based on the information you provide, as well as one payroll and all the necessary transfers.
As an supplementary service, we can offer additional payrolls, purchase invoices and their transfers.

As an additional service, we can offer more than one payroll calculation, more purchase invoices and their transfers.

| Service | Price |
| --- | --: |
| Payroll gross salary, with transfer | EUR **40** per invoice |
| Payroll net salary, with transfer | EUR **50** per invoice |
| Addition of purchase invoice with transfer | EUR **50** per invoice |

::how
## How does it work?

We will not calculate the payroll or pay out salaries until we have received all the necessary personal data and a valid income tax withholding certificate.

We will not prepare a sales invoice if the explanations and information provided and sent to us are incomplete or inaccurate, or if there is any doubt that the service and work did not actually take place.

We cannot be held liable for the quality of the work carried out by you and will not compensate for any damage caused by you. We are not and will not be a party to any contract, whether oral or written, with any natural person or legal entity offering you work.

Our service does not create any contractual or non-contractual employment or cooperation relationship between us, whether permanent or not, and any invoice sent by and through us and any payroll done by us is the content of our service. We only offer this service to you, not to the person who orders work from you.
